## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JS

### What I learned

By carrying out this project, I gained practical experience in planning in such a way that it would be easier to code later.


### Continued development

From this and the previous work, I concluded that I should look for more complex projects, so that it would be more interesting to work on them and gain more experience.
